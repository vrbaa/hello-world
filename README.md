My first GitHub repository
Hello dear Earthians... or Eathers... or just braÄ‡o Srbi! 

I'm here to learn something new that will help me when my college is over, which is going to take a while as it looks right now. My primary interest is web-dev, altough I don't know much about it (don't know shit!). I have some interest in Android as well, as I already made a simple app in Android Studio with my friend (actually, I just told him what to do, he knew the code). To change this braggy knowledge of mine, I shall get to work and stop bragging you about myself. Ahoy, Until the day I am billionaire, my dearest readers.
